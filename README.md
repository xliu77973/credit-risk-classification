Credit Risk Analysis Report

Analysis Purpose.
    
* This analysis aims to develop and assess the accuracy of a data model designed to predict the creditworthiness of potential borrowers using peer-to-peer lending services.

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.
    
* Balanced Accuracy Score: 96.79% --> this means that when taking into account the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the balanced prediction accuracy was 96.79%
* Precision Score: 92% --> This means 92% of predicted positives were correct
* Recall Score: 97% --> this means that the model was 97% precise in measuring true positive values our of all positive predictions made

Summarize the results from the machine learning model, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any.

* With over 95% accuracy, I would recommend to use this model. That accuracy range can be seamlessly integrated into a business risk profile to maintain sufficient capital flow, ensuring lenders remain operational and profitable.

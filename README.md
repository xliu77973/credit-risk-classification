Credit Risk Analysis Report

Analysis Purpose.
    
* The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model that predicts the credity worthiness of potential borrowers from peer-to-peer lending services

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.
    
* Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20% --> this means that when taking into account the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the balanced prediction accuracy was 95.2%
* Precision Score: 92% --> This means 92% of predicted positives were correct
* Recall Score: 95% --> this means that the model was 95% precise in measuring true positive values our of all positive predictions made

Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning:

* I would recommend using this model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, because it has over 95% accuracy in predicting the outcome of the repayment of the initial loan. That accuracy range could be easily molded into a business risk profile to ensure sufficient capital flow for the lenders to remain in business/make a profit.
